            <h2>Our Story & Growth</h2>
            <p>
                SLMYA began as a grassroots idea by a passionate youth advocate who believed in the potential of Sierra Leonean Muslim youth to lead and bring positive change. 
                Through dedication and community engagement, the initiative evolved from small gatherings into a structured organization. One of the most impactful steps in this journey was the strategic collaboration with institutions like Limkokwing University, which helped amplify the reach and resources of the association.
            </p>

                Today, SLMYA is recognized nationally for its integrity, transparency, and commitment to youth empowerment. It hosts conferences, skills development workshops, leadership summits, and spiritual programs that enrich the lives of many young Muslims.
